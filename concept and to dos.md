üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Gym Management System ‚Äì Full Project Plan
1. Tech Stack

Backend: Laravel (API for database + authentication + payments logic)

Frontend: React.js (modern UI, dashboard, member portal)

Database: MySQL (your schema)

Local Dev: XAMPP (MySQL + Apache)

Version Control: GitHub (so you can push your code there)

2. Core Features (based on schema + dev plan)

Authentication & Roles

Register/login with roles: Admin, Staff, Member

JWT or Laravel Sanctum for API auth

Admin Dashboard vs Member Portal views

Membership Plans

Admin creates/edit plans (monthly, yearly, etc.)

Members can subscribe

Track expiration via start_date + end_date

Flexible Access (Walk-ins)

Walk-in purchase (e.g., ‚Ç±100 for 1-day pass)

Records into walk_in_payments

Optionally capture name/phone

Payments

Record payments for both members + walk-ins

Payment methods: cash, gcash, card

Unified reporting (merge payments + walk_in_payments)

Analytics & Reporting

Daily/Monthly revenue trends (using analytics table or live queries)

Membership growth reports

Low membership renewal alerts

Member Portal

Members can view their active membership, renewal date, payment history

Walk-in users don‚Äôt have logins (unless you want to extend later)

Admin Dashboard

Manage users & memberships

View financial reports

Export data (CSV/Excel)

3. Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Backend (Laravel API)

 Create Laravel project

 Build migrations from schema

 Implement models + relationships

 Create authentication (Admin/Staff/Member roles)

 CRUD endpoints for Memberships, Flexible Access, Payments

Phase 2: Frontend (React.js)

 Create React project

 Setup routing (Admin Dashboard, Member Portal, Login/Register)

 Build UI with Tailwind/Material UI

 Connect to Laravel API with Axios

Phase 3: Integrations

 Payment handling (simulate first with cash/GCash)

 Analytics dashboard with charts (Chart.js/Recharts)

 Export reports

Phase 4: Deployment

 Push to GitHub

 Deploy backend (Laravel) + frontend (Vercel/Netlify)

 Optional: connect with real payment gateway (Stripe/PayMongo)

4. Next Step (What We Do Now)

üëâ We should start with Phase 1 ‚Äì Backend setup.

I can generate for you:

Laravel migrations for your schema (ready to run php artisan migrate)

Models with relationships (so Eloquent works out of the box)

Seeders (to populate default membership plans & roles)
