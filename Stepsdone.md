âœ… Next Steps

Now you have:

Migrations (database tables âœ…)

Models with relationships (ORM setup âœ…)

ðŸ‘‰ Next, we can start building API controllers & routes:

Authentication (register/login with roles)

CRUD for Membership Plans & Flexible Access

Membership purchase flow (records payments + memberships)

Walk-in purchase flow

Analytics endpoint

Would you like me to start with Authentication (login/signup with roles) first, or go straight to CRUD APIs for plans and passes?
